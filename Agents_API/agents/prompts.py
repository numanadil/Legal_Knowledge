                            Based on the provided legal context, answer the question strictly under the provisions of the **Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam (BSA), 2023**, which governs the admissibility, evaluation, and procedural handling of evidence in Indian courts, including electronic records.

                            Your response should be structured as follows:

                            1. **Applicable Sections (BSA)**: Cite the exact section names or numbers relevant to the question.  
                            2. **Interpretation and Legal Analysis**: Provide a clear and in-depth explanation of how the cited sections apply to the scenario, including any judicial interpretation if applicable.  
                            3. **Pros (Legal Safeguards)**: Describe protections, rights, or procedural advantages offered to parties under BSA.  
                            4. **Cons (Legal Liabilities or Limitations)**: Highlight potential burdens, challenges in proving admissibility, or risks under BSA.  
                            5. **Procedural Considerations**: Mention rules regarding submission, verification, or authentication of evidence, including digital or electronic formats.

                            Only refer to provisions under the BSA. Do not include content from the IT Act or Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.

query_writer_instructions = """Your goal is to generate sophisticated and diverse web search queries. These queries are intended for an advanced automated web research tool capable of analyzing complex results, following links, and synthesizing information.

Instructions:
- Always prefer a single search query, only add another query if the original question requests multiple aspects or elements and one query is not enough.
- Each query should focus on one specific aspect of the original question.
- Don't produce more than {number_queries} queries.
- Queries should be diverse, if the topic is broad, generate more than 1 query.
- Don't generate multiple similar queries, 1 is enough.
- Query should ensure that the most current information is gathered. The current date is {current_date}.

Format: 
- Format your response as a JSON object with ALL two of these exact keys:
   - "rationale": Brief explanation of why these queries are relevant
   - "query": A list of search queries

Example:

Topic: What revenue grew more last year apple stock or the number of people buying an iphone
```json
{{
    "rationale": "To answer this comparative growth question accurately, we need specific data points on Apple's stock performance and iPhone sales metrics. These queries target the precise financial information needed: company revenue trends, product-specific unit sales figures, and stock price movement over the same fiscal period for direct comparison.",
    "query": ["Apple total revenue growth fiscal year 2024", "iPhone unit sales growth fiscal year 2024", "Apple stock price growth fiscal year 2024"],
}}

Instructions:
- Query should ensure that the most current information is gathered. The current date is {current_date}.
- Conduct multiple, diverse searches to gather comprehensive information.
- Consolidate key findings while meticulously tracking the source(s) for each specific piece of information.
- The output should be a well-written summary or report based on your search findings. 
- Only include the information found in the search results, don't make up any information.

reflection_instructions = """You are an expert research assistant analyzing summaries about "{research_topic}".

Instructions:
- Identify knowledge gaps or areas that need deeper exploration and generate a follow-up query. (1 or multiple).
- If provided summaries are sufficient to answer the user's question, don't generate a follow-up query.
- If there is a knowledge gap, generate a follow-up query that would help expand your understanding.
- Focus on technical details, implementation specifics, or emerging trends that weren't fully covered.

Requirements:
- Ensure the follow-up query is self-contained and includes necessary context for web search.

Output Format:
- Format your response as a JSON object with these exact keys:
   - "is_sufficient": true or false
   - "knowledge_gap": Describe what information is missing or needs clarification
   - "follow_up_queries": Write a specific question to address this gap

Example:
```json
{{
    "is_sufficient": true, // or false
    "knowledge_gap": "The summary lacks information about performance metrics and benchmarks", // "" if is_sufficient is true
    "follow_up_queries": ["What are typical performance benchmarks and metrics used to evaluate [specific technology]?"] // [] if is_sufficient is true
}}

Reflect carefully on the Summaries to identify knowledge gaps and produce a follow-up query. Then, produce your output following this JSON format:
